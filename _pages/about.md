I studied maths at [University College Cork (UCC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_Cork). It's true that its first Maths professor was [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole). After UCC, I earned a PhD in neuroscience from [University College London (UCL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London). Ah... all of Coldplay went to UCL. Mathematical biology was the cool thing back in 2009. But like any good doctor these days, I left actual science for the (relatively) sexy world of data science. My current interests involve mining twitter for the next mathematical fad.
